"""Financials router

Exposes company-level **annual raw fundamentals** as stored in `financials_annual`.
This is the source-of-truth view for revenue, net income, cash & short-term
investments, total debt, and diluted shares (one row per fiscal year).

How it works:
- The endpoint takes a `company_id` (DB PK), queries all rows for that company,
  orders them by `fiscal_year`, and returns a list of Pydantic models.
- Numbers are returned as floats (or `null`) for frontend-friendliness.
- If the company has no rows yet (e.g., not ingested), it returns an empty list
  rather than 404 (since the company may exist but data is pending).

Design notes:
- We keep this endpoint *raw* and free of derived metrics. Anything computed
  belongs in `/metrics`.
- Provenance (tag/unit/accession) is not exposed hereâ€”query the provenance table
  by `financial_id` if you need audit details in the future.
